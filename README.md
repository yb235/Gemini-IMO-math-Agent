# MIO: A Multi-Agent AI System for Solving IMO Problems

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a sophisticated multi-agent AI system designed to solve complex mathematical problems, specifically those from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

The core idea, inspired by recent Google AI research, is to move beyond single-shot AI calls and instead create a collaborative team of specialized AI "agents." These agents work together in an iterative cycle of generation, verification, and correction to produce rigorous and accurate mathematical proofs.

The entire workflow is orchestrated using **LangGraph**, a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The system is designed as a stateful graph where each node is an "agent" with a specific role. These agents communicate and share information through a central `GraphState` object.

### The Agent Team

The primary script (`MIO 2.py`) utilizes the following agents:

1.  **üß† Generator**: The initial solver. It takes the problem statement and produces the first detailed draft of a solution.
2.  **üîÑ Self-Improver**: A crucial refinement step. This agent reviews the Generator's output, using an additional "thinking budget" to enhance clarity, fill potential gaps, and improve rigor *before* verification.
3.  **üîç Verifier**: The meticulous critic. Its sole purpose is to find flaws in the proposed solution. It does not solve the problem itself but produces a structured "bug report" detailing any logical errors or justification gaps.
4.  **üë§ Human Reviewer**: The quality gate. This "human-in-the-loop" step presents the Verifier's bug report to the user for approval. This prevents the AI from getting stuck trying to fix a misunderstood or non-existent error.
5.  **üîß Corrector**: The reviser. If the bug report is approved, this agent takes the original solution and the report and generates a new, corrected version.

### The Workflow

The agents collaborate in a cyclical process orchestrated by LangGraph:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B(Generator);
    B --> C(Self-Improver);
    C --> D{Verifier};
    E(Corrector) --> D;
    D -- Bugs Found --> F{Human Review};
    D -- Solution Correct --> G([End]);
    D -- Max Iterations --> G;
    F -- Approve Report --> E;
    F -- Reject Report --> G;
```

1.  The `Generator` creates a solution.
2.  The `Self-Improver` refines it.
3.  The `Verifier` checks the refined solution.
4.  **Decision**:
    - If correct, the process ends.
    - If flawed, the `Human Reviewer` is prompted.
5.  **Decision**:
    - If the human approves the bug report, the `Corrector` attempts a fix.
    - If the human rejects it, the process ends.
6.  The corrected solution is sent **back to the Verifier**, and the loop continues.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Leverages specialized agents for a robust problem-solving process.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The generate-verify-correct loop allows the system to improve its own work.
*   **Self-Improvement Step**: A proactive refinement stage that significantly improves the quality of the initial solution.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop**: A pragmatic control point to guide the AI and prevent dead-ends.
*   **Structured I/O with Pydantic**: Ensures reliable, predictable data flow between agents.
*   **Verbose & Formatted Logging**: Provides clear, real-time insight into the "thinking process" of each agent.

## üìÇ File Descriptions

*   `MIO.py`: The foundational, simpler version of the workflow. It's a great starting point for understanding the basic `Generator -> Verifier -> Corrector` loop.
*   `MIO 2.py`: The advanced and recommended version. It includes the `Self-Improver` agent, more sophisticated prompts, robust error handling, and a much-improved user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MIO-solver.git
cd MIO-solver
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The project uses a few key packages. You can install them directly:

```bash
pip install langchain langgraph langchain-google-genai python-dotenv pydantic
```

### 4. Set Up Your API Key

This project uses the Google Gemini API.

1.  Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.
2.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

Alternatively, the script will prompt you to enter the key if it's not found in your environment.

## üèÉ How to Run

To run the advanced workflow, execute the `MIO 2.py` script:

```bash
python "MIO 2.py"
```

The script will first ask you to enter a mathematical problem. You can paste your own or press Enter to use the default IMO "windmill" problem.

During the run, you will see detailed output from each agent. If the `Verifier` finds issues, you will be prompted to approve or reject its findings, like this:

```
üéØ DECISION REQUIRED:
Do you agree with the verifier's assessment?
‚Ä¢ Type 'y' to APPROVE the bug report and proceed with correction
‚Ä¢ Type 'n' to REJECT the bug report and end the workflow

üë§ Your decision (y/n): y
```

At the end of the process, a comprehensive final report is generated, summarizing the problem, the workflow, and the final proposed solution.

## üí° Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here are some ideas for potential improvements:

*   **Parallel Generation**: Implement a "Generator" that creates multiple candidate solutions, followed by a "Ranker" agent to select the most promising one.
*   **Tool Usage**: Allow agents to use tools like a Python interpreter for symbolic math calculations (`sympy`).
*   **Web UI**: Build a simple web interface using Streamlit or Flask to make the process more interactive.
*   **Model Flexibility**: Abstract the LLM initialization to easily switch between different models (e.g., Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT-4).
